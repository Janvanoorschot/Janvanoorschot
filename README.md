# Developer/Teacher

I am passionate about making things and finding out how stuff works.
Although I also make furniture, drawings and bogeys, creating software pays the bills.
Creating software using the latest technologies has been my thing for more than forty years and I have always completed a project that I started. I do my best work in a motivated team.

Given my years in the academic world, you can expect me to be able to read, write, talk and teach.
